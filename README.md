# parallelizing_dijkstras_algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm solves “the single-source shortest path problem” in a weighted, di- rected graph. The input consists of a weighted, directed graph and a specified vertex in the graph. A directed graph or digraph is a collection of vertices and directed edges, which join one vertex to another. A weighted digraph has numerical weights assigned to the vertices and/or the edges.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem
